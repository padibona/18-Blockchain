# PyChain Ledger

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

For this homework we were to create a virtual 'blockchain' using Python. The requirements were to create a web application that will allow a user to add an entry to the ledger and see the blocks added to the 'chain'. There will be a button which will allow a user to 'validate' the blockchain, and report that status to the screen.
